I’m James Rodriguez. I live in Barcelona, Spain.
 I’m Spanish. I work for a publicity agency. 
I’m married and I have two small children. 
I usually wake up at 7 o’clock. 
I stay in bed till 8. 
Then I have breakfast with my wife and my children.
I go to work by bus, but on Monday, Tuesday and Friday I go by car. 
I start work at 9.30. At 12.30 I have lunch in the Chinese restaurant opposite my office. 
I come back home at 6.20 in the evening.
 In summer I work different hours because many people are on their holidays during this season. 
I have my holiday in August. 
I travel to the coast of the ocean with my family so August is a favourite month of my family.
