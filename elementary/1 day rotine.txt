My wife and I wake up at about 7 when our two-year old daughter Alice gets up. I have a shower and eat breakfast at 8 o’clock. I play rugby for Manchester and work for the British Gas Company.
My office is a 15 minute drive from my home in Manchester. I start work at 9. I have lunch at home because it is not far from my office. I finish work at half past five. My wife and I don’t go out very often in the evening because of Alice, so friends visit us at home. I go to bed late in the evening because I watch TV.
In the rugby season (September to May) I train and do exercises every evening and play matches every weekend. In the summer I travel for six to eight weeks with the Manchester rugby team.





I stay in bed one hour after I wake up. Then my housekeeper brings me my breakfast. After that I take a bath and get dressed. At half past ten I leave for my office. It takes me 20 minutes to get to it.
I live and work in the center of Paris. I have lunch in a small Italian restaurant opposite my office. I stay in my office until 8 and then I have dinner at home. It is always after one o’clock when I go to bed. I spend my weekend with my friends. Usually we go to the cinema or theatre at weekends. Sometimes we go shopping or just walk along the streets of Paris.
