I知 Simon Riddle. 
I知 an engineer. 
I work for a small building company. 
I live in London. 
My family is not large: my wife, my son Jacob and I. 
On my weekdays I work very hard and I知 very tired. 
I love my little son Jacob but I知 too busy with my work to spend time with him in the evening on my weekdays. 
But I spend all weekends with him. This is one of them. 
We wake up early in the morning, at about 7 o団lock. 
Then we watch cartoons on TV. It is very fun. 
We have breakfast together at 9.30. 
Then we get dressed and go for a walk. 
Jacob likes playing in the park. 
Sometimes we play tennis, sometimes we ride a bike, and sometimes we run.
 We take hamburgers, chips, milk and tea and have a picnic just on the grass. 
We have lunch at about 12.45. 
After lunch we go to the cinema or to the zoo. We enjoy watching animals.
