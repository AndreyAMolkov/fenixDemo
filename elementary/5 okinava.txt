Takanashi always walks three kilometers a day, and he sometimes rides a motorbike. 
He often works in his garden, and he usually does martial arts in the morning. 
Takanashi lives on the island of Okinawa in Japan. In Okinawa people live a very long time. 
They are hardly ever ill. 
Many people live to be 100 – more people than in other parts of the world. 
Why? What is their secret? 
The Okinawans eat vegetables, fruit, fish, soya and rice. 
They usually have seven portions of fruit and vegetables a day. 
People do not usually drink much alcohol or smoke. 
They do not eat much meat or fast food. 
Physical activity is very important for people of Okinawa. 
Martial arts, walking, traditional dancing, and gardening are very popular with people of all ages. 
In many countries people have healthy diets and do exercises. 
But the usual thing about the people in Okinawa is that they are not stressed. 
They are relaxed and take their time.
 Buses are hardly ever on time, and people often arrive an hour late for meetings. 
Every evening hundreds of people, young and old, go to the beach to watch the beautiful sunset. 
People often meditate to relax. 
Another important thing is that people often work until they are 80 – sometimes until 90! 
In the Okinawan dialect there is no word for ‘retired’. 
They are busy and active all their lives. 
Old people do not stay at home – they go out and meet friends.
 When journalist ask people “What is the secret of your long life?’, they answer ‘We are happy, we are always positive, and we are never in a hurry’.
