Hi, I’m Garry Robison. I’m from Miami. 
I’m married and I have three children.
 Our family is in love with music. 
My wife and I are professional musicians. 
We even have a small family orchestra.
 My wife can play the piano. 
I can play the guitar.
 Our daughter Helen can play the violin. 
Our son Jeremy goes to a musical college.
 He is going to be a professional musician too.
 He plays the accordion very well. He’s number one in his group. 
Jeremy is a winner of some famous musical festivals.
 Our son Miguel is just 4. He can’t play any musical instruments, but he likes listening to music. 
He is our loyal fan.
