Malcolm Tracey doesn't go to work: he only leaves his home town to go on holiday in the Caribbean with his family. 
But Malcolm is a millionaire. 
He writes books about money, and how to make a lot of it. 
His new book is called Easy Money: How to make money without getting out of bed. 
Malcolm lives in a large house in Bray, a town about 40 kilometres from London. 
He gets up at about 9 o'clock in the morning, and  has breakfast with his family. 
After breakfast, he drives his children to school in his white Rolls Royce and reads the newspaper in his garden until lunchtime.
 After lunchtime he sells and buys on the Internet. 
He finishes work at 4 o'clock when his children come home.
 'I've got a simple system for making money,' Malcolm says.
 'It doesn't work for everybody but it works for me.
